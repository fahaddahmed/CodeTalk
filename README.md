# 🗨️ CodeTalk

Welcome to **CodeTalk**, a web application designed to foster seamless and secure communication among computer science students and enthusiasts. Powered by Flask, this platform offers an intuitive chatting experience tailored to the needs of the tech-savvy community.

## 🎯 Motivation

The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of full-stack web development, covering key aspects like deployment, backend operations, and user security. Additionally, this project served as a valuable hands-on experience to enhance my skills in Python development. It's important to note that while the initial codebase supported room creation, this feature was adjusted in the final release to ensure content appropriateness.

## ✨ Features

- **Secure User Registration and Authentication:** Complete system handling user sign-up, login, and session management.
- **Room Customization:** Capability to create custom chat rooms. *(Note: This feature is adjusted in the final deployment to ensure content appropriateness.)*
